# FestivalCreator
FestivalCreator is a simple app where you can add movies, programs, movies to programs and create a Festival. 

I'm dividing my code in separate logical modules (UI, DATA and MAIN) by using Module Pattern, and exposing only methods that should be public while rest stays encapsulated.

# Showcasing 

    -   Module Exposing Design Pattern
    -   MVC-like data structure
    -   Encapsulation
    -   Prototypes
